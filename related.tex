\subsubsection*{Regular Language Generation}
\citet{DBLP:journals/jfp/McIlroy04} implements the enumeration of
strings of regular languages in Haskell. He develops two approaches,
one based on interpreting regular expressions, the other using an
intermediate representation as a nondeterministic finite
automaton. The approach is inspired by an earlier note by Misra
\cite{misra11:_enumer_strin_regul_expres} and uses operators based on
an increasing list representation similar to our first proposal.

However, the approach does not consider the complement operation and
none of the presented representations can readily deal with
it. Moreover, the generation method is reported to be very inefficient
and thus not suitable for generating test inputs at a large scale.

\citet{DBLP:conf/wia/LeeS04} discuss enumerating regular expressions
and their languages. Despite the title, this work is unrelated
because it aims to find bounds on the number of languages that can be
represented with regular expressions and automata of a certain size.


\subsubsection*{Language Generation}
Some authors discuss the generation of test sentences from grammars for
exercising compilers
(e.g., \cite{DBLP:conf/cisse/ParachaF08,DBLP:conf/compsac/ZhengW09}
for some recent work). This
line of work goes back to Purdom's sentence generator for testing
parsers \cite{purdom72:_senten_gener_testin_parser}, which creates
sentences from a context-free grammar using each production at least
once.

Compared to our generator, the previous work starts from context-free
languages and aims at testing the apparatus behind the parser,
rather than the parser itself. Hence, it focuses on generating
positive examples, whereas we are also interested in counterexamples.

Grammar Testing~\cite{DBLP:conf/fase/Lammel01} aims to
identify and correct errors in a grammar by exercising it on example
sentences. The purpose is to recover ``lost'' grammars of programming
languages effectively.
Other work \cite{DBLP:conf/compsac/LiJLG04} also targets
testing the grammar, rather than the parser.
