\subsection{Segmented representation}
\label{sec:segm-repr}

Two operations on the LLO representation, \code{concatenate} and
\code{star}, internally transform their inputs into segment
sequences. Such a transformation forth and back seems wasteful, so we
stipulate to perform the entire generation in terms of segment
sequences. The transformation to a language only happens as the final
step. Thus, the operations in this subsection manipulate languages in
terms of the following type:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
type SegLang = [[T.Text]]
\end{lstlisting}

As a second refinement, we try to address the productivity concerns
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:motivation-discussion}. The approach is
to let finite segment sequences represent finite languages. Hence, the
base cases for the interpretation of regular expression may be defined
as in Figure~\ref{fig:base-cases-segmented}.
\begin{figure}[tp]
\begin{lstlisting}
zero :: SegLang
zero = []

one :: SegLang
one = [[T.empty]]

atom :: Char -> SegLang
atom t = [[], [T.singleton t]]
\end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Implementation of base cases for segmented language representation}
  \label{fig:base-cases-segmented}
\end{figure}
The implementation of \code{union}, \code{intersect}, and
\code{difference} (and hence \code{complement}) is an easy exercise and thus omitted.
We discuss the remaining issues with the code for concatenation in
Figure~\ref{fig:preliminary-concatenation-segmented}. 
\begin{figure}[tp]
\begin{lstlisting}
concatenate' :: SegLang -> SegLang -> SegLang
concatenate' lx ly = collect 0
  where
    collect n =
      (foldr ILO.union [] $ map (combine n) [0 .. n]) : collect (n+1)
    combine n i =
      [T.append x y | x <- lx !!! i, y <- ly !!! (n - i)]
\end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Preliminary implementation of concatenation for segmented
    language representation}
  \label{fig:preliminary-concatenation-segmented}
\end{figure}
It relies on a special indexing operation into a list of lists that returns an empty
list if indexing occurs beyond the end of a segment list:
\begin{lstlisting}
(!!!) :: [[a]] -> Int -> [a]
[]       !!! n = []
(xs:xss) !!! 0 = xs
(xs:xss) !!! n = xss !!! (n - 1)
\end{lstlisting}
This change makes \code{concatenate'} amenable to work with finite
segment lists, 
but any concatenation of languages yields an infinite list of
segments. To avoid that we need a termination criterion for
\code{collect} to determine whether any future call can make a
non-empty contribution.

To this end, we extend the code to keep track of the lowest index
seen in \code{lx} and \code{ly} where the respective segment list is
exhausted, say, $m_x$ and $m_y$ (if they exist). These indexes
are upper bounds for the length of the longest word in \code{lx} and
\code{ly} such that $\forall x \in \code{lx}$ it must be that
$|x|\le m_x-1$ and analogously for \code{ly}. Hence, the longest word in
the product is bounded by $|xy| = |x| + |y| \le m_x -1 + m_y -1$. In
consequence, if $n \ge m_x + m_y - 1$, then no word of
length $n$ can be constructed by concatenation of elements from
\code{lx} and
\code{ly}. Figure~\ref{fig:finite-concatenation-segmented} contains
the corresponding extension of \code{concatenate}. It makes use of
\code{liftA2} used at type \code{(Int -> Int -> Int) -> Maybe Int ->
  Maybe Int -> Maybe Int} to add two values of type \code{Maybe
  Int} if they are present.\footnote{The function \code{liftA2 ::
    Applicative f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c} is taken from
the standard module \code{Control.Applicative}.}
\begin{figure}[tp]
\begin{lstlisting}
concatenate lx ly =
  collect lx ly Nothing Nothing 0
  where
    collect xss yss mmx mmy n =
      let (xss', mmx') = updateMax xss mmx n
          (yss', mmy') = updateMax yss mmy n
          mbound = liftA2 (+) mmx mmy
      in
        case mbound of
          Just m | n > m ->
                   []
          _ ->
            (foldr ILO.union [] $ map (combine n) [0 .. n]) :
            collect xss' yss' mmx' mmy' (n+1)
    combine n i =
      [T.append x y | x <- lx !!! i, y <- ly !!! (n - i)]
    updateMax _ mm@(Just _) n = ([], mm)
    updateMax [] Nothing n = ([], Just n)
    updateMax (_:xss) Nothing n = (xss, Nothing)
\end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Finiteness preserving implementation of concatenation}
  \label{fig:finite-concatenation-segmented}
\end{figure}

The finite cases for \code{star} ($U^* = \{\varepsilon\}$ iff
$U\subseteq\{\varepsilon\}$) are straightforward to detect and thus not further discussed.

\subsection{Assessment}
\label{sec:interm-assessm}

The segmented representation has a number of features that makes it
well suited for use in practice. We discuss these features in turn and
consider further minor improvements in the subsections to follow.

\subsubsection{Productivity}
Each generalized regular expression is interpreted by a productive
(finite or infinite) stream of segments. Each segment is guaranteed to
be a total, finite list of words. There is no partiality in this representation.

\subsubsection{Easy Bounding}
To restrict the generated segmented output \code{segs} to words of length less than a given
bound \code{n}, all we need to do is \code{take n segs}. The result is
a finite list of words. In contract, such filtering is not effective
for the LLO representation where \code{takeWhile (\w -> T.length w <
  n) llo} may generate a partial list.

\subsubsection{Finite Languages}
Segmentation yields a finite representation for all finite languages
defined without using the \code{complement} operation. While
$\Lang{\Rcomplement{(\Rcomplement{\Rnull})}} = \emptyset$ is a finite 
language, the output of \code{complement (complement zero)} is an
infinite list of empty segments.

In Section~\ref{sec:more-finite-repr}, we discuss ways to get finite
representations from more languages, but in general it is
not possible to guarantee that a finite language is represented by a
finite stream of segments.

\subsection{Faster Concatenation}
\label{sec:faster-concatenation}

Looking back at the code in
Figure~\ref{fig:preliminary-concatenation-segmented}, we see that the
invocation of \code{collect n} leads to $n$ invocations of the list
indexing operations \code{lx !!! i} and \code{ly !!! (n - i)}, which
results in an  overall complexity of $O (n^2)$.\footnote{We assume that
GHC is sufficiently clever to pull \code{ly !!! (n - i)} out of the loop.}

There are a number of different ways to reduce this complexity.

\subsubsection{Convolution}
\begin{figure}[tp]
\begin{lstlisting}
concatenate'' :: SegLang -> SegLang -> SegLang
concatenate'' lx ly = collect ly []
  where
    collect (ysegn:ysegs) rly =
      let rly' = ysegn : rly in
      (foldr ILO.union [] $ zipWith (liftA2 T.append) lx rly') :
      collect ysegs rly'
\end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Concatenation with convolution}
  \label{fig:concatenation-with-convolution}
\end{figure}
The \code{combine} operation is an example of a convolution where
indexing proceeds in opposite directions. The \code{collect} operation
could take advantage of it and build a reversed list \code{rly} of already
processed segments of \code{ly}. With this extra data structure, the
iteration of \code{combine} can be implemented by a linear time
\code{zipWith} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:concatenation-with-convolution}.

For simplicity, the code in the figure only handles infinite lists of
segments. But when extended with handling the case for finite lists,
it gives rise to a very nice optimization. If \code{lx} is finite,
then the \code{zipWith} automatically stops unnecessary indexes in
\code{ly}. Conversely, if \code{ly} starts with some empty segments
because all its words are longer than some lower bound, then these
segments safely could be omitted from \code{rly}.

This consideration reveals that the implementation
\code{concatenate''} is is inherently asymmetric because it does not
exploit the finiteness of \code{ly}.

\subsubsection{Sparse indexing}
