\section{\ocaml implementation}
\label{sec:ocaml}

\lstset{language=[Objective]Caml}

In addition to the \haskell implementation, we implemented our language generator
in \ocaml. One of the goal of this implementation was to test
pure \ocaml regular expression libraries such as \mysc{re}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-re}} and
\mysc{mulet}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/let-def/mulet}}. 
The other was to experiment with strictness and various data-structure for
segments.

Indeed, as long as all the words in each segment are of the same length,
they can be stored in any data structure that support set operations.
In order to test this, we implemented our algorithm as a functor as shown in \autoref{code:sigs}.
Our functor takes as argument two data-structure: words and segments.

\paragraph{Character and Words}

The signature for words in shown in \autoref{code:sigs:word}.
Surprisingly few operations are needed for words: Indeed, we mostly requires the ability to build the empty word (for \code{One}),
words of one char (for \code{Atom}) and to append words
with each others. Notably, we do not require an ordering on words, as we will
see in more details in the description of \code{SEGMENT}.
The \code{length} operation is only required in order to classify
words in segments in the \code{import} function, but is not necessary for the
main algorithm, since all segment operations return words of known lengths.

In practice, such a signature is easily satisfied by the \ocaml \code{string}
type (\ie arrays of bytes), arrays or lists of characters, or by ropes. The
type of individual characters is completely unrestricted.

\paragraph{Segments}
