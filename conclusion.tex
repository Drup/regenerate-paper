\section{Conclusion and Future work}

\TODO{}

In \cref{sec:bench}, we saw that the performance of our generator highly depends
both on the shape of the language and the shape of the regular expression.
We noticed a rough correlation with the size of each segments, but did not
provide a more precise account. One might wonder if such an account is possible
and if yes, can we use this information to improve language generation
(by transforming a regular expression to an equivalent yet more efficient one).
