Regular expressions are one of common tool of the everyday programmer.
They are used for a wide variety of tasks and how to parse them is both
a well explored area, yet one that still receives frequent contributions.
It is somehow surprising than testing regular expression implementation
doesn't have a satisfying solution. Even using property based testing, one
still needs to rely on an external oracle. Furthermore,
the presence of an oracle does not help with generating both positive and
negative inputs for a given regular expressions.

We propose an algorithm to generate languages matched by \emph{generalized}
regular expressions with union, intersection and complement operator.
The complement operator allows us to generate both positive and negative inputs
for a given regular expression, thus removing the need for an oracle.
We implement our generator in \haskell and \ocaml,
and show that its performances are more than
adequate for the purpose of testing.
