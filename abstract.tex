Regular expressions are part of every programmer's toolbox.  They are
used for a wide variety of language-related tasks and there are many algorithms for
manipulating them. In particular, matching algorithms that detect
whether a word belong to the language described by a regular
expression is both a well explored area, 
yet one that still receives frequent contributions. However, there is
no satisfactory solution for testing such matchers, which would
require generating positive as well as negative examples for the language. 

We propose an algorithm to generate a language matched by a \emph{generalized}
regular expression with intersection and complement operators.
The complement operator allows us to generate both positive and
negative example words
from a given regular expression.
We implement our generator in \haskell and \ocaml,
and show that its performance are more than
adequate for the purpose of testing.
