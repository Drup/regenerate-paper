Regular expressions are part of every programmer's toolbox.  They are
used for a wide variety of language-related tasks and there are many algorithms for
manipulating them. In particular, matching algorithms that detect
whether a word belongs to the language described by a regular
expression are well explored, 
yet new algorithms appear frequently. However, there is
no satisfactory methodology for testing such matchers.

We propose a testing methodology which is based on generating positive
as well as negative examples of words in the language. To this end, we
present a new algorithm to generate the language described by a
generalized regular expression with intersection and complement
operators.  The complement operator allows us to generate both
positive and negative example words from a given regular expression.
We implement our generator in Haskell and OCaml and show that its
performance is more than adequate for testing.
