\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}


In \cref{sec:bench}, we saw that the performance of our generator highly depends
both on the shape of the language and the shape of the regular expression.
We noticed a rough correlation with the size of each segments, but did not
provide a more precise account. One might wonder if such an account is possible
and if yes, can we use this information to improve language generation
(by transforming a regular expression to an equivalent yet more efficient one).


Generalize to words with weights by replacing boolean with another semiring.

Generate CFLs in this way?

Any decidable language can be enumerated in this way!

Faithful representation as a formal power series: stream of coefficients from a semiring.

Amenable to formalization in Agda?
